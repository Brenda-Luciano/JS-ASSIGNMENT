    <h3>1. Name the three ways to declare a variable?</h3>

    <p>To declare a variable we can use: var, let and const.</p>

    <h3>2. Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?</h3>

    <p> Var because it has the global escope and it is not limited to the block in which is declared.</p>

    <h3>3. What rules should you follow when naming variables?</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Names should be descriptive, simple and human-readable.</li>
        <li>Avoid abbreviations.</li>
        <li>Choose the right terms according to your team and the users.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>4. What should you look out for when using the + operator with numbers and
        strings?</h3>

    <p>The NaN values, that represent a computational error.</p>

    <h3>5. How does the % operator work?</h3>

    <p>The % operator (The modulus operator) returns the division remainder.</p>

    <h3>6. Explain the difference between == and ===.</h3>

    <p>The operator == means equal value and the === operator means equal value and equal type.</p>

    <h3> 7. When would you receive a NaN result?</h3>

    <p>You receive a NaN result when the value can't be computed or is an invalid number.</p>

    <h3>8. How do you increment and decrement a number?</h3>

    <p>To increment a number we use the operator ++ and to decrement a number we use the operator --.</p>

    <h3>9. Explain the difference between prefixing and post-fixing increment/decrement
        operators.</h3>

    <p>Increment: with Prefix, the increment operator adds and returns the value after the incrementing. With Postfix,
        the increment operator adds
        and returns the value before the increment.</p>
    <p>Decrement: with Prefix, the increment operator subtracts and returns the value after the decrementing. With
        Postfix, the increment operator subtracts
        and returns the value before the decrementing.</p>

    <h3>10. What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?</h3>

    <p>Operator precedence determines how operators are ordered; operators with higher precedence are evaluated first
        and become the operands of
        operators with lower precedence.</p>

    <h3>11. How do you log information to the console?</h3>

    <p>The console.log() method outputs a message to the console.</p>

    <h3>12. What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers?</h3>

    <p>The unary plus operator converts strings into numbers.</p>

    <h3>13. What are the eight data types in JavaScript?</h3>

    <p>Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Null, Undefined, BigInts, Symbols and Properties.</p>

    <h3>14. Which data type is NOT primitive?</h3>

    <p>The object.</p>

    <h3>15. What is the relationship between null and undefined?</h3>

    <p>The two are similar but not identical. Null is a variable that represents a missing value and Undefined is a
        variable
        that represents something that does not exist.</p>

    <h3>16. What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes for strings?</h3>

    <p>Single and Double quotes are practically the same but the Backtick quotes are extended funcionality quotes (they
        allow us to
        set variables and expressions into a string).</p>

    <h3>17. What is the term for embedding variables/expressions in a string?</h3>

    <p>String Interpolation.</p>

    <h3>18. Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions in a string?</h3>

    <p>The Backtick quotes.</p>

    <h3>19. How do you embed variables/expressions in a string?</h3>

    <p>By wrapping them in ${...}.</p>

    <h3>20. How do you escape characters in a string?</h3>

    <p>By using the backslash \ .</p>

    <h3>21. What is the difference between the slice/substring/substr string methods?</h3>

    <p>The Slice string method extracts from the end of the string if the starting index is negative.</p>
    <p>The Substring will see the negative start index as 0.</p>
    <p>The Substr extracts part of a string and begins at a specified position, and returns a specified number of
        characters.</p>

    <h3>22. What are the three logical operators and what do they stand for?</h3>

    <p> The three logical operators are: && (AND), || (OR) and ! (NOT).</p>

    <h3>23. What are the comparison operators?</h3>

    <p>Comparison operators are the ones that compare values and return true or false.</p>

    <h3>24. What are truthy and falsy values?</h3>

    <p>Truthy are values considered to be true and falsy are values considered false in a Boolean context.</p>

    <h3>25. What are the falsy values in JavaScript?</h3>

    <p>The falsy values are: 0 , 0n , null , undefined , false , NaN , and "" .</p>

    <h3>26. What are conditionals?</h3>

    <p>Conditionals are operators that determine the conditions in an expression.</p>

    <h3>27. What is the syntax for an if/else conditional?</h3>

    <p>
        if (condition) {
        // to be executed if the condition is true
        } else {
        // to be executed if the condition is false
        }
    </p>

    <h3>28. What is the syntax for a switch statement?</h3>

    <p>
        switch (new Date().getDay()) {
        case 0:
        day = "Sunday";
        break;
        case 1:
        day = "Monday";
        break;
        case 2:
        day = "Tuesday";
        break;
        case 3:
        day = "Wednesday";
        break;
        case 4:
        day = "Thursday";
        break;
        case 5:
        day = "Friday";
        break;
        case 6:
        day = "Saturday";
        }
    </p>

    <h3>29. What is the syntax for a ternary operator?</h3>

    <p>condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse</p>

    <h3>30. What is nesting?</h3>

    <p>Nesting is when you write something inside of something else.</p>

    <h3>31. What are functions useful for?</h3>

    <p>Functions are used to store a piece of code that does one task inside a defined block and then call that code
        when needed using a single
        short command (not having to type out the same code several times).</p>

    <h3>32. How do you invoke a function?</h3>

    <p>By including the name of the funcion in the code somewhere.</p>

    <h3>33. What are anonymous functions?</h3>

    <p>Anonymous functions are the ones withe no name and can only be accessed by a variable.</p>

    <h3>34. What is function scope?</h3>

    <p>They are variables that are declared inside a function.</p>

    <h3>35. What are return values?</h3>

    <p>They are values that a function returns after it's completed.</p>

    <h3>36. What are arrow functions?</h3>

    <p>It's a simple way to create functions (ex: =>).</p>
